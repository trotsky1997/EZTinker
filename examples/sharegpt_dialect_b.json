        "content": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that involves training algorithms to make predictions or decisions based on data. Deep learning is a specialized subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (deep networks) to learn complex patterns in data.\n\nKey differences:\n\n1. **Architecture**: Traditional ML uses algorithms like decision trees, SVMs, and linear regression, while deep learning uses multi-layer neural networks.\n\n2. **Feature Engineering**: ML often requires manual feature engineering, while deep learning can automatically learn features from raw data.\n\n3. **Data Requirements**: Deep learning typically requires much larger datasets to train effectively.\n\n4. **Performance**: Deep learning often achieves superior performance on complex tasks like image recognition and natural language processing.\n\n5. **Computational Resources**: Deep learning requires significantly more computational power (GPUs) compared to traditional ML."
